# hello!!!!!

Using [loan data from Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) we use machine learning to predict the risk of loan defaults. Additionally, using the results from the predictive modeling, we improve the potential return on investment. <br>
Details of the implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ZhuLeon/Loan-Default-Prediction/blob/master/src/README.md).

## Introduction

Suppose a bank wants to know whether potential loan applicants will default on a loan. Loan information for a client is provided and a binary outcome of fully paid or default is predicted. We will use logistic regression, random forest, neural network, xgboost, and ensemble classifieres to create a model. This will provide useful metrics and help improve return on investment for the company.

## Model Details

Many models were trained and fitted, but the final model chosen is a ensemble model by stacking method:
![Model_Details](./src/imgs/Model_Details.svg)

## Model Results

    Model Accuracy: 68%
    Overall return without model: -20.62%
    Overall return with model: -7.90%
    Overall percent improvement: 84.04%

![Returns](./src/imgs/returns.png)

* Left: If the model predicted fully paid with 75% probability, this would be categorised to be in the 70% - 80% range
* Right: If the model predicted 75% probability, the average improvement is 18%
* With increasing probabilities, there is an increasing improvement on return until the 80% â€“ 100% range. In this range, few to no loans are defaulted on so there is not much opportunity to improve returns
